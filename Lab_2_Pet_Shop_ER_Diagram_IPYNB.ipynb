        "I have tried to make the ER diagram as simple as possible. I tried to use a complete entity-relationship diagram (ERD) using Crow's foot notation, which includes Entities, Attributes, Primary Keys for each Entity, Foreign Keys (where needed), Relationships (including a verb), Connectivity, and Cardinality. My 6 big tables are pets, enclosure, food, transaction food, customer, and transaction pet. I also added the primary keys and foreign keys for each table. Under every table, I tried to add at least there information factors that I can identify the table. For example, in the pet table, there is enclosure, food, color, and age. For other tables, I tried to make the information as unique and distinctive as possible. "
