        "<p>Our idea is for a Bookstore business. We plan to gather data regarding the customersâ€™ wants such as the book they are looking for, the genre, where it is located, the price, and whether or not they want to utilize the cafe. This idea is unique as it uses information and data from a bookstore and uses it to convey typical data that would be collected in a scenario similar. This business is not brand new as it borrows from the bookstore blueprint. A typical interaction at the bookstore would go as follows: a customer interacts with the store employee looking for a book. The employee asks what the title and genre of the book is. Using this information the employee can find the aisle based on the genre of the book. The customer is told the price of the book and asks whether or not there is a cafe available for refreshments. He or she is then informed of the availability of said cafe. The goal with the data collected using this database model would be too see which books are more popular and whether or not a cafe being present is a beneficial </p>\n",

        "<p>Our idea is to for a farm business. This will help make interactions between customers and sellers easier and more accessible to sell and buy products. Our idea is to help consumers to get the products they want as convenient as they can so, there will be information about what type of product, what type of animals, what type of farming equipment, all of its prices will be provided. This is borrowed from another business but we added some new aspects to the business by having really livestock in the store. A typical business interaction would mostly be people buying and selling products that were produced that day at the farm, and the employees will be interacting with the customers to sell the products for the day. The goal is to have to get how many items are being sold and which items are being sold the most through the tables from the items and their cost. </p>\n",

        "<p>Our idea is to gather information about flight patterns and ticket costs, to help make air travel information more accessible to the people. Our idea is to compile critical flight information for a consumer to make a decision on buying a ticket to a specific destination. This information will help the consumer to determine the location of the airport, total flight time, and the company that they would be flying with. This idea has been implemented by many companies already, like Kayak and Expedia. A typical business day would involve many interactions between consumers and ticket suppliers. The consumers would need to be able to access the databases containing information about flight details and costs. The suppliers would need to access the database regarding how many tickets are still available.  The goal for this project is to help consumers make cost-effective decisions on the means of transportation while also helping suppliers to determine which flights and specific details are the most popular among consumers. </p>\n",
